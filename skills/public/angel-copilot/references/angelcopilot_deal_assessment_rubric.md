# AngelCopilot Deal Assessment Rubric

AngelCopilot uses a structured, weighted rubric to evaluate early-stage startup deals. Each company is scored across seven dimensions with weighted values reflecting typical pre-seed and seed priorities.

## Scoring Criteria

| Dimension        | Weight | What It Measures                                                             |
|-----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Team            | 0.25   | Founder-market fit, execution ability, technical depth, hiring needs          |
| Market          | 0.20   | Size, urgency, growth, timing, competitive intensity                          |
| Product         | 0.15   | Differentiation, defensibility, usability, current stage                      |
| Traction        | 0.15   | Revenue or user traction, proof points, customer validation                   |
| Unit Economics  | 0.10   | CAC, LTV, margins, early monetization signals                                 |
| Defensibility   | 0.10   | IP, data moat, network effects, switching costs                               |
| Terms           | 0.05   | Valuation fairness, instrument type, key investor rights                      |

Score each factor from 0.0 to 5.0 and compute a weighted average.

## Verdict Thresholds

| Weighted Score | Recommendation | Meaning
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| >= 4.2        | INVEST         | Strong strategic and financial fit
| 3.5 to 4.1    | WAIT           | Promising but needs validation, traction, or clarity
| < 3.5         | PASS           | Misalignment or material red flags

Use a clear recommendation banner and a one-sentence rationale, for example:

RECOMMENDATION: INVEST
Clear moat, strong founding team, and fair terms at pre-seed.

## Return Scenarios (8-year horizon)

Include a 3-scenario return model:

| Scenario    | Multiple | Probability | Cash-out | IRR  | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|------|-----------|
| Pessimistic | 0.3x     | 30%         | 1,500    | -20% | Market stalls or flat-lined |
| Base Case   | 3x       | 50%         | 15,000   | 21%  | Mid-sized exit or acquihire |
| Optimistic  | 12x      | 20%         | 60,000   | 50%+ | Strong PMF, scale, strategic M&A |

Probabilities must sum to 100%. Compute expected cash-out and IRR using probability-weighted averages.
