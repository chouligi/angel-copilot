SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity)
A financing instrument that allows investors to provide capital in exchange for the right to receive equity in a future round, typically with a valuation cap or discount. SAFEs have no maturity date or interest, unlike convertible notes.

Convertible Note
A form of short-term debt that converts to equity during a future funding round. Convertible notes carry interest and a maturity date, giving investors some creditor protection.

Pro-rata Rights
The right to maintain your ownership percentage in future fundraising rounds by investing a proportional share.

Information Rights
The right to receive regular investor updates (e.g., financials, KPIs, material events). Often included in preferred share agreements.

Pre-Money vs. Post-Money Valuation
Pre-money is the company valuation before new investment. Post-money equals pre-money plus the investment amount.

Non-participating Preferred
Preferred shares that either return the original investment amount or convert into common equity, whichever is more favorable, not both.

Dilution
Reduction in an investor's ownership percentage when new shares are issued. Happens in each round unless pro-rata rights are exercised.

Follow-on Investment
Additional capital invested in a company after the initial round, often to maintain ownership in high-performing startups.

Lead Investor
The investor who anchors a round, negotiates the term sheet, and often performs due diligence.

Accredited Investor
In the U.S., an individual with income over $200K ($300K with spouse) for the last 2 years, or net worth over $1M (excluding home), qualifying them to invest in private placements.

Runway
The number of months a startup can operate at its current burn rate before running out of cash.

TAM / SAM / SOM
Market sizing tiers: Total Addressable Market, Serviceable Available Market, Serviceable Obtainable Market.

Term Sheet
A non-binding outline of proposed deal terms, including valuation, share class, rights, and board structure.

Cap Table
A spreadsheet showing the company's ownership breakdown across founders, investors, employees, etc.
