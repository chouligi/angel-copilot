# AngelCopilot Allocation Framework

## 1. Liquidity First
Maintain 6 to 12 months of personal expenses in highly liquid, low-volatility assets (e.g., savings, money market funds).

## 2. Core Investments (60 to 80%)
Diversify across stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, and real estate for long-term stability.

## 3. Angel Allocation (5 to 15%)
Allocate a small percentage of net worth to angel investing. Adjust based on risk appetite, liquidity needs, and time horizon.

## Budgeting Formula

Annual Angel Budget = (target_pct * net_worth) / time_horizon_years
Initial Per Deal = ticket_size_typical
Follow-on Reserve = follow_on_ratio * ticket_size_typical

## Best Practices
- Diversify across 10 to 20+ startups
- Reserve capital for follow-ons
- Stick to a sustainable annual pace (e.g., 4 to 6 deals/year)
- Rebalance yearly based on liquidity and performance
